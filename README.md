# rpic
This project is an exercise to transplant the particle-in-cell(PIC) simulation to Rust community.

basically 1D algorithm and just a skeleton of the evolution of fields and particle densities, radiation and bremsstrahlung modules are not included.

just for my learning in Rust and try to complete a project.

any dicussion is warmly welcomed.
